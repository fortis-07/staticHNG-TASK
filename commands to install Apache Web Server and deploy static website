Install Apache Web Server: Once connected to your EC2 instance via SSH, run the following commands to install Apache, start it, enable it to start on boot, and check its status:
sudo yum update -y  # Update package index
sudo yum install httpd -y  # Install Apache
sudo systemctl start httpd  # Start Apache
sudo systemctl enable httpd  # Enable Apache to start on boot
sudo systemctl status httpd  # Check Apache status
Create and Edit index.html: Navigate to the Apache web root directory (/var/www/html/) and create/edit index.html file with your website content:

cd /var/www/html/
sudo vim index.html

Paste your HTML content.
{See index.html}
Save and exit Vim (:wq).
Access Your Website: Use your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address to access your static website in a web browser:
http://your_ec2_public_ip/
By following these steps, you should have your static website deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using Apache successfully.
