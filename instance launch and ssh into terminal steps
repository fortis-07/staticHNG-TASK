Launch Instance:
Go to AWS EC2 console.
Click on “Launch Instance”.
Choose “Amazon Linux 2 AMI” (or any desired Linux distribution).
Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro free-tier).
Create a new key pair or use an existing one to connect to your instance securely via SSH.
Configure instance details (leave defaults or adjust as needed).
Add storage (default is usually sufficient).
Create a new security group.
Add a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) from your IP address to the security group.
Review and launch the instance.
SSH into the Instance: Using the command prompt terminal on your local machine to connect to the instance using SSH. Replace your_key.pem with the actual path to your private key and ec2-user with your instance's username (this is typical for Amazon Linux):
ssh -i /path/to/your_key.pem ec2-user@your_ec2_public_ip
